                    Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the
                    scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

                    Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use
                    depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.

                    Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great
                    career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a
                    traditional university degree to become qualified.

                    The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and
                    back-end (the server side). Let’s delve into the details.

                What is HTML?

                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections,
                    paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

                    HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic
                    functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to
                    Microsoft Word.

                    When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website
                    page.

                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to
                    structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed
                    images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts,
                    colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has
                    one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a
                    mid-century modern home).

                    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
                    web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
                    you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
                    scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
                    layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
                    much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
